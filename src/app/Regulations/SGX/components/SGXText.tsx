          Singapore is positioning itself as a leader in sustainable finance, and the{" "}
          <span className="font-semibold">Singapore Exchange (SGX)</span>, 
           sustainability reporting framework is central to this transition. Unlike voluntary ESG initiatives, 
           SGX mandates listed companies to disclose material environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors aligned with international standards such as <span className="font-semibold"> TCFD and IFRS S1 & S2. </span>

        <p>
          SGX reporting strengthens{" "}
          <span className="font-semibold">transparency, investor trust, and market</span> {" "}
          confidence by requiring companies to provide verified, comparable data on climate risks, emissions, governance, and sustainability targets. For businesses, SGX compliance is no longer just a regulatory obligationâ€”it is a strategic opportunity to attract global capital, build resilience, and position themselves as credible, future-ready leaders in a fast-evolving sustainable economy.
