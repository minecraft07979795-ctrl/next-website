          "Companies exporting carbon-intensive goods (e.g., aluminum, steel, cement, fertilizers, electricity, hydrogen) to the EU must submit CBAM reports",
      },
      {
        question: "When do CBAM requirements take effect?",
        answer:
          "The transitional phase runs 2023â€“2025 with mandatory emissions reporting. From 2026, importers will pay a carbon levy.",

        question: "Who will be affected by Malaysia's carbon tax?",

          "High-emission sectors such as energy, heavy manufacturing, and resource-based industries will progressively be brought under the national carbon tax.",

      },
      {
        question: "Will disclosures require third-party verification?",
        answer:
          "Yes. The EU requires emissions to be independently verified; Malaysia's framework is also expected to mandate assurance.",

        question: "Is there a digital tool to simplify compliance?",

        question: "How does carbon pricing in Malaysia affect businesses?",

          "It introduces additional compliance costs but also creates opportunities to access green financing and improve operational efficiency.",

      {
        question: "How does Carbon-Zero.ai support compliance?",
        answer:
