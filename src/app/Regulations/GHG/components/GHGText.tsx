          Global stakeholders are increasingly focused on{" "}
          <span className="font-semibold"> greenhouse gas (GHG)</span>, 
          accountability, making robust emissions reporting essential. Unlike general sustainability frameworks, GHG reporting requires companies to measure, track, and disclose their Scope 1, 2, and material Scope 3 emissions, along with mitigation strategies and reduction targets.

          By integrating emissions data into business decisions and providing transparent, comparable information on carbon footprint, energy use, and reduction initiatives, GHG reporting strengthens credibility and investor confidence.
          For companies, it’s not just a regulatory requirement—it’s a strategic opportunity to optimize operations, attract green financing, and lead the transition to a low-carbon economy.
