          Malaysia’s listed companies now face stricter requirements under{" "}

          which aligns with global standards like IFRS S1 and S2. From 2025 onwards, issuers must provide{" "}
          <span className="font-semibold">transparent, comparable ESG disclosures,</span>. 
          covering governance, strategy, risks, metrics, and targets. For large-cap companies especially,{" "}
          <span className="font-semibold"> data quality, assurance readiness, and supply chain engagement</span> 
          will be critical to meeting investor expectations and maintaining market confidence.

          This means businesses must prepare for{" "}
