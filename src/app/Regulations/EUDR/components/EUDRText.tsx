          Malaysia, a leading exporter of{" "}
          <span className="font-semibold">palm oil, rubber, cocoa, and timber</span>, 
          now faces stricter requirements under the{" "}
          <span className="font-semibold">European Union Deforestation-free Regulation (EUDR)</span>. 
          From 2024 onwards, exporters must ensure products are{" "}
          <span className="font-semibold">deforestation-free, legally sourced, and fully traceable</span> 
          down to plantation level, supported by{" "}
          <span className="font-semibold">geolocation data and due diligence records</span>. 
          For Malaysia’s palm oil and rubber sectors in particular,{" "}
          <span className="font-semibold">supply chain transparency and sustainability certification</span> 
          will be critical to maintaining access to the EU market.
        </p>

        <p>
          At the same time, the{" "}
          <span className="font-semibold">Malaysian government</span>, through the{" "}
          <span className="font-semibold">Ministry of Finance</span>, is developing a{" "}
          <span className="font-semibold">carbon pricing framework</span>, 
          beginning with a{" "}
          <span className="font-semibold">Voluntary Carbon Market (VCM)</span> 
          and moving toward a{" "}
          <span className="font-semibold">carbon tax</span> as outlined in the National Energy Transition Roadmap. 
          This means industries must prepare for{" "}
          <span className="font-semibold">dual compliance pressures</span> – meeting EUDR export requirements 
          while adapting to domestic carbon pricing.
        </p>

        <p>
          Though challenging, these measures create opportunities for Malaysian producers 
          to build resilience, enhance global reputation, and{" "}
          <span className="font-semibold">gain a competitive edge in sustainable trade</span>.
